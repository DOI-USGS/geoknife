Tools for geo-web processing of gridded data via the [Geo Data Portal](http://cida.usgs.gov/gdp/ "Geo Data Portal"). `geoknife` slices up gridded data according to overlap with irregular features, such as watersheds, lakes, points, etc. The result is subsetted data in plain text, NetCDF, geotiff or other formats.

###Installing `geoknife`

To install the `geoknife` from CRAN:  
``` r
install.packages("geoknife")
```

To install the stable version of `geoknife` package with dependencies:  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("geoknife", 
    repos = c("http://owi.usgs.gov/R","http://cran.rstudio.com/"),
    dependencies = TRUE)
```

Or to install the current development version of the package:  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('USGS-R/geoknife')
```

###`geoknife` overview
The `geoknife` package was created to support web-based geoprocessing of large gridded datasets according to their overlap with landscape (or aquatic/ocean) features that are often irregularly shaped. `geoknife` creates data access and subsequent geoprocessing requests for the USGS's Geo Data Portal to carry out on a web server. The results of these requests are available for download after the processes have been completed. This type of workflow has three main advantages: 1) it allows the user to avoid downloading large datasets, 2) it avoids reinventing the wheel for the creation and optimization of complex geoprocessing algorithms, and 3) computing resources are dedicated elsewhere, so `geoknife` operations do not have much of an impact on a local computer. 

`geoknife` interacts with a remote server to figure out what types of processing capabilities are available, in addition to seeing what types of geospatial features are already available to be used as an area of interest (commonly, these are user-uploaded shapefiles). Because communication with web resources are central to `geoknife` operations, users must have an active internet connection. 

The main elements of setting up and carrying out a `geoknife` 'job' (`geojob`) include defining the feature of interest (the `stencil` argument in the `geoknife` function), the gridded web dataset to be processed (the `fabric` argument in the `geoknife` function), and the the processing algorithm parameters (the `knife` argument in the `geoknife` function). The status of the `geojob` can be checked with `check`, and output can be loaded into a data.frame with `result`. 

###What can `geoknife` do?
#####define a stencil that represents the geographic region to slice out of the data
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(geoknife)
# from a single point
stencil <- simplegeom(c(-89, 46.23))
   # -- or --
# from a collection of named points
stencil <- simplegeom(data.frame(
              'point1' = c(-89, 46), 
              'point2' = c(-88.6, 45.2)))
   # -- or --
#for a state from a web available dataset
stencil <- webgeom('state::New Hampshire')
stencil <- webgeom('state::New Hampshire,Wisconsin,Alabama')
   # -- or --
#for HUC8s from a web available dataset
stencil <- webgeom('HUC8::09020306,14060009')
```
#####define a fabric that represents the underlying data
```{r}
# from the prism dataset:
fabric <- webdata('prism')
   # -- or --
# explicitly define webdata from a list:
fabric <- webdata(list(
            times = as.POSIXct(c('1895-01-01','1899-01-01')),
            url = 'http://cida.usgs.gov/thredds/dodsC/prism',
            variables = 'ppt'))
# modify the times field:
times(fabric) <- as.POSIXct(c('2003-01-01','2005-01-01'))
```
#####create the processing job that will carry out the subsetting/summarization task
```{r}
job <- geoknife(stencil, fabric, wait = TRUE)

# use existing convienence functions to check on the job:
check(job)
```
see also: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
running(job)
error(job)
successful(job)
```
#####plot the results
```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=7}
data <- result(job)
plot(data[,1:2], ylab = variables(fabric))
```

#####use an email to listen for process completion
```{r, eval=FALSE}
job <- geoknife(webgeom('state::New Hampshire'), fabric = 'prism', email = 'fake.email@gmail.com')
```
