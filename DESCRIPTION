Description: Processes gridded datasets found on the U.S. Geological Survey
    Geo Data Portal web application or elsewhere, using a web-enabled workflow
    that eliminates the need to download and store large datasets that are reliably
    hosted on the Internet. The package provides access to several data subset and
    summarization algorithms that are available on remote web processing servers.
