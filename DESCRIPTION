Description: The geoknife R package processes gridded datasets found on the 
  U.S. Geological Survey Geo Data Portal web application or elsewhere, 
  using a web-enabled workflow that eliminates the need to download and store 
  large datasets that are reliably hosted on the Internet. The package provides 
  access to several data subset and summarization algorithms that are available 
  on remote web processing servers.
